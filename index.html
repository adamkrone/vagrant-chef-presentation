      <h1>Vagrant and Chef</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>What is Vagrant?</h2>

      <p>
        Vagrant is tool that allows you to define virtual machine configuration. It supports
        a number of targets, the most common of which is VirtualBox.
      </p>

      <p>
        To create a new Vagrant configuration:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: shell">
        $ vagrant init chef/ubuntu-14.04
      </script>

      <p>
        'chef/ubuntu-14.04' is a base box. Base boxes define a base installation of an
        operating system. This allows you to always start from a known-good configuration
        of our system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>What is Chef?</h2>

      <p>
        Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby. It allows you to define
        your system's configuration as code.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
      <p>
        Maintaining systems is hard. Even if we create detailed documentation, we can't
        be certain that operator error won't cause issues down the road. By codifying
        our environment, we can be sure that things get configured correctly every time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>The Vagrantfile</h2>

      <p>A typical Vagrantfile looks like this:</p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
          config.vm.box = 'chef/ubuntu-14.04'

          config.omnibus.chef_version = :latest

          config.vm.define 'dev' do |node|
            node.vm.hostname = 'my-app.dev'
            node.vm.network 'private_network', ip: '192.168.200.50'
            node.vm.synced_folder './', '/var/www/my-app/current'

            node.vm.provision 'chef_solo' do |chef|
              chef.add_recipe 'my-app::development'
            end
          end
        end
      </script>

      <p>
        You can use a Vagrantfile to define many virtual machines, and spin up
        entire clusters. Most configurations, however, are much simpler.
      </p>

      <p>The official docs are pretty good, and include plenty of examples.</p>
      <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/">Vagrant Docs</a>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Your First Cookbook</h2>

      <p>
        The ChefDK includes all the utilities you'll need to write and run your own cookbooks.
        We can use the 'chef' tool to generate a cookbook:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: shell">
        $ chef generate cookbook my-app
        Compiling Cookbooks...
        Recipe: code_generator::cookbook
          * directory[/Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app] action create
            - create new directory /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app
          * template[/Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/metadata.rb] action create_if_missing
            - create new file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/metadata.rb
            - update content in file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/metadata.rb from none to 2973ef
            (diff output suppressed by config)
          * template[/Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/README.md] action create_if_missing
            - create new file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/README.md
            - update content in file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/README.md from none to 0645e5
            (diff output suppressed by config)
          * cookbook_file[/Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/chefignore] action create
            - create new file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/chefignore
            - update content in file /Users/adamkrone/Projects/github/adamkrone/vagrant-chef-presentation/cookbooks/my-app/chefignore from none to 9727b1
            (diff output suppressed by config)
          ...snipped...
      </script>

      <p>This creates all the basic files we'll need to start developing our cookbook.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Introducing Test Kitchen</h2>

      <p>
        When using the ChefDK generator, it creates a basic Test Kitchen configuration.
        We can use this to run our cookbook during development to make sure it's working.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: shell">
        $ kitchen converge
        $ kitchen login
      </script>

      <p>
        Later, we'll also take a look at how we can use Test Kitchen to automate testing
        of our cookbooks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Writing a Recipe</h2>

      <p>
        Chef recipes are written in Ruby, but normally rely heavily on Chef Resources.
        Resources are statements of configuration that perform actions to bring your
        system to a desired state. Resources abstract the implementation and allow you
        to focus on a few key details.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, we might want to install the Apache web server package:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        package 'apache2'
      </script>

      <p>
        We would also probably want to enable the apache2 service, and make sure it's
        started:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        service 'apache2' do
          action [:enable, :start]
        end
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Creating Files</h2>

      <p>
        There are a couple of ways to create files. The simplest is to create a file
        with some content.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
          content '<h1>Vagrant and Chef</h1>'
          action :create
        end
      </script>

      <p>
        A more useful method is to copy a file from the cookbook onto the system
        we're provisioning.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        cookbook_file 'index.html'
          path '/var/www/html/index.html'
          action :create
        end
      </script>

      <p>In this case, index.html exists in a files directory at the root of the cookbook.</p>

      <p>We can also fetch remote files:</p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        remote_file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
          source 'http://example.com/index.html'
          owner 'root'
          group 'root'
          action :create_if_missing
        end
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Idempotence</h2>

      <p>
        In the last example, you may have noticed that we used the :create_if_missing
        action. This is an important concept in configuration management tools called
        idempotence.
      </p>

      <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">
        <p>
          <strong>Idempotence</strong> is the property of certain operations in mathematics
          and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the
          result beyond the initial application
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Creating Files from Templates</h2>

      <p>
        If we want to create files that are flexible, we can use templates and pass
        in variables for better code re-use.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        template '/var/www/html/index.html' do
          source 'index.html.erb'
          variables(title: 'Vagrant and Chef')
          action :create
        end
      </script>

      <p>Templates use ERB and might look like this:</p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        <h1><%= @title %></h1>

        <p>Elit impedit ullam ratione accusantium fugit dignissimos. Quia tempora dicta
        assumenda iusto labore. Maxime dolorum impedit ratione quisquam maiores expedita.
        Quisquam fuga aut nisi reiciendis perspiciatis harum! Temporibus ullam nemo.</p>
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Flexible Cookbooks Using Attributes</h2>

      <p>
        Chef uses attributes as a way to maximize cookbook reuse. Chances are you will want
        to configure a number of servers with the same software, but with slightly different
        configuration. By using templates and attributes you can make any cookbook more
        flexible.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        template '/var/www/html/index.html' do
          source 'index.html.erb'
          variables(title: node['my_app']['title'])
          action :create
        end
      </script>

      <p>
        Here we have updated the index.html template to use an attribute for its title.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Using Other Cookbooks</h2>

      <p>
        Up until now, we've just been doing everything ourselves. Instead, we can rely
        on the cookbooks others have created.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        include_recipe 'apache2::default'
      </script>

      <p>
        When you include recipes, the cookbook and recipe is separated by '::'. In this
        case, we're including the apache2 cookbook's default recipe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Berkshelf</h2>

      <p>
        Before we can use other cookbooks, we need a way to manage where we get them.
        We can always download the cookbooks and include them in the repo, but there
        is another tool that handles that for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Berkshelf allows us to specify our cookbook dependencies in a Berksfile:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        source "https://supermarket.chef.io"

        cookbook 'apache2'
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Testing Your Cookbook</h2>

      <p>
        The more complicated our cookbook becomes, the more valuable it will be to have
        automated testing. That way, anytime we make a change, we can be reasonably sure
        that we haven't broken anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Test Kitchen allows us to organize tests in 'suites' that can be run across multiple
        operating systems and configurations. We'll be using a single suite written in
        ServerSpec to test our cookbook.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        suites:
          - name: default
            run_list:
              - recipe[my-app::default]
            attributes:
              my_app:
                title: Vagrant and Chef
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Writing a ServerSpec Test</h2>

      <p>
        If you've used RSpec before, ServerSpec will be familiar, as it's an extension of RSpec.
        Here's a basic test for our cookbook.
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
        require 'spec_helper'

        describe 'my-app::default' do
          describe package('apache2') do
            it { should be_installed }
          end

          describe service('apache2') do
            it { should be_enabled }
            it { should be_running }
          end

          describe file('/var/www/html/index.html') do
            it { should be_file }
            it { should contain 'Vagrant and Chef' }
          end
        end
      </script>

      <p>
        We could add another test that makes sure our index.html file is written. Now, whenever we
        want to see if our cookbook is working, we can run:
      </p>

      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: shell">
        $ kitchen test
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Putting it all Together</h2>

      <p>
        As you can see, Chef is a very powerful tool, and when used along with Vagrant and Test Kitchen,
        you can automate any infrastructure. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the concepts, and
        Chef has more advanced topics to learn. The important thing is to start small and build your
        cookbooks as you progress.
      </p>

      <p>Automating even a few small things here and there can have huge wins.</p>
